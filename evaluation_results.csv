What therapy options has the NCCN Panel recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data?,"['The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends molecular testing based on clinical trial data, but strongly advises broader molecular profiling, to identify these and other rare driver mutations for which targeted therapies may be available to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment; patients may be eligible for clinical trials for some of these targeted agents.¹⁷³ Several online resources are available that describe NSCLC driver events, such as My Cancer Genome. Resources are available to assess whether the HER2 mutations are oncogenic or likely to be oncogenic (see oncoKB.org).¹⁷⁴', 'The NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend erlotinib as switch maintenance therapy (or as subsequent therapy) for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, good PS, and negative test results for actionable driver mutations based on results from IUNO, a randomized trial, and a revised indication from the FDA.⁸⁹³ The NCCN NSCLC Panel also does not recommend switch maintenance therapy with erlotinib in patients with squamous cell NSCLC, because overall survival and quality of life were not improved.742,894 A phase 3 trial assessed switch maintenance therapy with docetaxel given either immediately after gemcitabine plus carboplatin or delayed until progression in patients with advanced NSCLC; however, many patients in the delayed chemotherapy arm did not receive docetaxel.⁸⁹⁵ Previously, the panel deleted the recommendation for switch maintenance therapy with docetaxel for patients with squamous cell NSCLC because there are better options.895,896', 'First-line targeted therapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive test results for actionable driver mutations such as ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1. Second-line targeted therapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive test results for EGFR exon 20 insertions or KRAS p.G12C mutations. First-line immunotherapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for actionable driver mutations. Immunotherapy options may be used as first-line or for surgical resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Definitive RT, preferably SABR, is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC who are medically inoperable or refuse surgery; RT can be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients at high risk of complications (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion and see Initial Treatment for Stage I and II', 'The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends entrectinib, crizotinib, or repotrectinib as preferred first-line treatment options for patients with ROS1-positive advanced or metastatic NSCLC, while ceritinib is considered an “other recommended” first-line treatment option.

"What imaging studies are recommended to rule out metastatic disease in patients with T1–2,N2 disease confirmed before thoracotomy?","['The role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented N2 disease remains controversial. Two randomized trials evaluated the role of surgery in this population, but neither showed an overall survival benefit with the use of surgery. However, this population is heterogeneous and the Panel believes that these trials did not sufficiently evaluate the nuances present with the heterogeneity of N2 disease and the likely oncologic benefit of surgery in specific clinical situations.  \n- The presence or absence of N2 disease should be vigorously determined by both radiologic and invasive staging prior to the initiation of therapy since the presence of mediastinal nodal disease has a profound impact on prognosis and treatment decisions. (NSCL-1, NSCL-2, NSCL-3, NSCL-5, NSCL-8, NSCL-11, NSCL-13, and NSCL-14)', 'resulted in a 16% incidence of positive N2 nodes discovered only at the time of thoracotomy. The negative predictive value of 89%.⁹¹¹ Kernstine et al compared PET scan to CT scan for identifying N2 and N3 disease in NSCLC.⁹¹² The PET scan was found to be more sensitive than the CT scan in identifying mediastinal node disease (70% vs. 65%). FDG PET/CT has been shown to be useful in restaging patients after adjuvant therapy.913,914 When patients with early-stage disease are accurately staged using FDG PET/CT, inappropriate surgery is avoided.⁹¹⁵', 'Patients with a history of lung cancer or those with biopsy-proven synchronous lesions may be suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers.96,97 It is important to determine whether the multiple lung cancers are metastases or separate lung primaries (synchronous or metachronous); most multiple lung tumors are metastases.86,394,941,942 Lesions with different cell types, such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma, are usually different primary tumors. However, lesions of the same cell type may not be metastases. Therefore, it is essential to determine the histology of the lung tumor (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Infection and other benign diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, inflammatory granulomas).98,99 Although criteria have been established for diagnosing multiple lung cancers, no definitive method has been established before treatment.100 The Martini and Melamed criteria are often used to diagnose multiple lung cancers as', 'After patients are confirmed to have NSCLC based on a pathologic diagnosis, a clinical evaluation needs to be done (see update in Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with symptoms, the clinical stage is initially determined from disease history (ie, cough, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain) and physical examination together with a limited battery of tests (see Initial Evaluation and Clinical Stage in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends that smoking cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy be provided to patients. After the clinical stage is determined, the patient is assigned to one of the pathways that are defined by the stage, specific subdivision of the particular stage, and location of the tumor. Note that for some patients, diagnosis, staging, and surgical resection are done during the same operative procedure. A multidisciplinary evaluation should be done before treatment.', 'PET/CT imaging is useful before selecting a biopsy site, because it is better to biopsy the site that will confer the highest stage. For patients with suspected nodal disease, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is recommended with either noninvasive or invasive staging methods, including endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), EBUS–guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), navigational bronchoscopy, robotic bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy (see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Clinicians use both noninvasive and invasive methods when staging patients.¹⁰⁹ The panel decided that a preoperative bronchoscopy may also be preferred for tissue diagnosis and/or mediastinal staging (EBUS). EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 3P, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, 11 to 13, and other hilar nodal stations.']","The recommended imaging study to rule out metastatic disease in patients with T1–2, N2 disease is a brain MRI with contrast, particularly if aggressive combined-modality therapy is being considered. The routine use of bone scans to exclude bone metastases is not recommended (nscl.pdf, page n/a).","Image-guided thermal ablation (eg, cryotherapy, microwave, RFA) is an option for selected patients who are medically inoperable and not receiving SABR or definitive RT (see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In some instances, positive mediastinal nodes (N2) are discovered at surgery; in this setting, an additional assessment of staging and tumor resectability must be made, and the treatment (ie, inclusion of systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection) must be modified accordingly. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines include two different tracks for T1–2,N2 disease (ie, stage IIIA disease): 1) T1–2,N2 disease discovered unexpectedly at surgical exploration; and 2) T1–2,N2 disease confirmed before thoracotomy. In the second case, an initial brain MRI with contrast and FDG PET/CT scan (if not previously done) are recommended to rule out metastatic disease.",0.0,0.9078019211501004,0.99999999998
