1. A waiver is necessary based on what is known or what can be determined about the prevalence or incidence in the U.S. of the disease or condition for which the new drug or device is being developed.
2. The appropriateness of a waiver is a case-specific determination and will depend on factors relevant to a specific development program.
3. The FDA may evaluate whether certain criteria are satisfied when considering whether a waiver is appropriate (fda_guidance.pdf, page n/a). 

For more detailed information, it is advisable to consult a clinician.",1. A waiver is necessary based on the prevalence or incidence of the disease or condition in the U.S.; 2.
