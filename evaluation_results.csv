What was the overall survival rate after 5 years for patients who received durvalumab compared to those who received placebo?,"['rate in both groups of patients (durvalumab, 30.5% vs. placebo, 26.1%). Pneumonia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event (durvalumab, 4.4% vs. placebo, 3.8%). Durvalumab did not compromise patient-reported outcomes. An updated analysis of this trial reported that overall survival was increased after durvalumab consolidation (47.5 months; 95% CI, 38.4–52.6) compared with placebo (29.1 months; 95% CI, 22.1–35.1) (stratified HR for death, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68). After 5 years, 42.9% of patients who received durvalumab were alive versus 33.4% of those who received placebo. In addition, 42.9% were alive after 5 years if they had received durvalumab and 33% were alive and free of disease progression compared with 19% of those who received placebo. The subgroup analyses were limited by small sample size and were not powered to assess efficacy. Patients receiving durvalumab received less subsequent immunotherapy (11.6%) compared with those who received placebo (28.3%).', 'Durvalumab is a human ICI antibody that inhibits PD-L1 (see PD-L1 Expression Levels and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion). PACIFIC, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared adjuvant treatment with durvalumab (also known as consolidation immunotherapy in this setting) versus placebo in eligible patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC (PS 0–1) but without disease progression after treatment with 2 or more cycles of definitive concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation. Eligible patients received adjuvant durvalumab after treatment with concurrent chemoradiation (1–42 days). Most patients either currently or previously smoked cigarettes and did not have EGFR mutations; their PD-L1 status was typically less than 25% or unknown. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at a similar rate in both groups of patients (durvalumab, 30.5% vs. placebo, 26.1%). Pneumonia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event (durvalumab, 4.4% vs. placebo, 3.8%). Durvalumab did not compromise', 'Most patients received the pemetrexed regimen. Most patients either currently smoked cigarettes (25%) or had previously smoked (57%). The median overall survival was 14 months (95% CI, 11.7–16.1) in patients receiving tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus 11.7 months (95% CI, 10.5–13.1) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; P=.003). Subgroup analysis showed that overall survival was similar between the groups for squamous cell histology and other subgroups.', 'HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38–0.77; P = .0002) (pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 17.3 vs. 8.2 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36–0.70; P &#x3C; .0001). When compared with docetaxel, there were fewer grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events at either dose of pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg: 13% [43/339] of patients, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg: 16% [55/343] of patients; and docetaxel: 35% [109/309] of patients). A total of six treatment-related deaths occurred in patients receiving pembrolizumab (three at each dose) and five treatment-related deaths occurred in the docetaxel arm. Long-term data from KEYNOTE-010 show that 5-year survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC is approximately 15.6% for patients who received subsequent pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 6.5% for those receiving docetaxel. For patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, 5-year overall survival was about 25% for patients receiving pembrolizumab versus 8.2% for those receiving docetaxel, respectively.¹¹']","After 5 years, the overall survival rate for patients who received durvalumab was 42.9%, compared to 33.4% for those who received placebo (nscl.pdf, page n/a).","rate in both groups of patients (durvalumab, 30.5% vs. placebo, 26.1%).
